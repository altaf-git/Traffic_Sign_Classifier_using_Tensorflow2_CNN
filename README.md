# Traffic_Sign_Classifier_using_Tensorflow2_CNN
Build Extremely good performing Traffic_sign_classifier on GTSRB datasets.
Important Note:To work this ipynb file directly to your jupyter notebook just download GTSRB file from mentioned link https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign and extract all its folder and put this ipynb file to that folder and run it.
I have even added a module to check your own single image and rather printing its sign name it will print its sign photo to whom it belongs
I have Used 4 Convolutional layers followed by 2 Maxpool layers. used 2 fully connected dense layer at last for better prediction.
The whole training time would take around 10 mins to train and I have used 9 epoch to prevent overfit of my weights
And if you like my work please give a star.
